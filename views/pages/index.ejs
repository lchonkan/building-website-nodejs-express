              The Roux Academy gets thousands of submissions every year for artists interesting in
              participating in the CAC exhibits, and selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of
              contemporary art for display in their collective exhibit. In addition, 12 individuals
              are honored as Featured Artists - each being granted his or her own exhibit hall to
              display entire collections or themed pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at one of our meetups and share his
              or her vision, perspective, and techniques with attendees on a more personal level
              than at our large conference. It is truly an honor to be a CAC Featured Artist and
              many past students artists who were featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant careers
              in art.
